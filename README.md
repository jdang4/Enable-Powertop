# Enable-Powertop

# Requirements
This is obvious, but to run this script you would have to have Powertop installed. You can install powertop by running the corresponding command in your terminal (didn't list all).

## Fedora
```
sudo dnf install powertop
```

## Ubuntu
```
sudo apt-get install powertop
```
